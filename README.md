# Azure-Siem-Geolog-Simulation
A hands-on simulation project that demonstrates how to set up and monitor a public-facing virtual machine in Microsoft Azure using SIEM principles. The setup intentionally exposes a Windows VM to generate real-world security logs, which are collected, analyzed, and visualized using Azure Log Analytics and geolocation-based threat mapping.
