# üõ∞Ô∏è Azure SIEM Geolocation Simulation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** simulation using **Microsoft Azure**.
The setup replicates a real-world environment where a **public-facing Windows Virtual Machine (VM)** is intentionally exposed to the **public internet** to attract real attackers.
The generated attack logs are ingested into **Azure Log Analytics** and visualized in **Microsoft Sentinel**, including **geolocation-based threat mapping**.


This project provides a practical understanding of how Security Operations Centers (SOCs) collect, detect, and visualize cyber threats in real time.

### Components:

1. **Public Internet:** Represents real-world attackers scanning and exploiting open ports.
2. **Azure Virtual Machine (VM):** A Windows Server machine exposed to the internet (with the firewall disabled) to simulate attacks.
3. **Network Security Group (NSG):** Disabled or relaxed to allow inbound traffic from the internet.
4. **Log Analytics Workspace:** Collects and stores logs from the VM for monitoring and query analysis.
5. **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM):** Visualizes data, detects patterns, and displays geolocation of attacks on a world map.

## üöÄ Setup Guide

### **1. Create Azure Resources**

* Create a **Free or Paid Azure Subscription**:
  [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account)
* Inside your subscription, create a **Resource Group** and a **Virtual Network (VNet-SoC)**.

![Resource Group](images/1.png)

### **2. Deploy a Windows Virtual Machine**

![Project Architecture](images/3-4.png)

* Create a **Windows VM** (In this case, Windows 11).
* During setup:
  * Allow **RDP (port 3389)** and **HTTP (port 80)**.

    ![RDP](images/3-2.png)
  * Turn off NSG rules for testing and Create a new inbound rule to allow traffic from anywhere.

    ![NSG Rule](images/4.png)

  * Log into the VM via RDP, Disable **Windows Firewall** to expose the machine.
 
    ![RDP Login](images/7.png)
    
  * Ping the VM via from your local machine
 
    ![Ping](images/8.png)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *This VM will be publicly accessible. Do not use sensitive credentials or store personal data.*
>
> At the end of this stage, the project's architecture is as shown below:

![Part1](images/EoP1.png)

### **3. Enable Log Collection**

* Go to **Azure Monitor ‚Üí Logs ‚Üí Create Log Analytics Workspace (LAW)**. In this case, my LAW is called JPCORP-SoC-SA-1

  ![LAW1](images/9.png)

  ![LAW2](images/10.png)
  
* Create a **Sentinel Instance** and connect it to Log Analytics.
  
* Configure the **Windows Security Events via AMA** connector

  ![WSE](images/11.png)
  
  ![WSE](images/12.png)

  
* Create the **Data Collection Rule (DCR)** within sentinel, watch for extension creation

    ![DCR](images/13.png)

    ![DCR1](images/14.png)
  
    ![DCR2](images/15.png)
  
* Query for logs within the LAW to test the connectivity

  ![Query](images/16.png)

## At the end of this part, the lab architecture is shown below:
  ![Part2](images/EoP2.png)
  

### **4. Generate Logs**

* Leave your VM exposed for a few hours or days.
* Logs will automatically start populating with brute-force, RDP, and network scan attempts.

### **Part 5. Log Enrichment and Finding Location Data**
  * Import a geoipsummarized.csv (as a ‚ÄúSentinel Watchlist‚Äù) which contains geographic information for each block of IP addresses.

    ![LE](images/17.png)
    
  * Within Sentinel, create the watchlist:

        > Name/Alias: geoip
        > Source type: Local File
        > Search Key: network

  * Allow the watchlist to fully import, there should be a total of roughly 54,000 rows.

    ![LE](images/18.png)
*In real life, this location data would come from a live source or it would be updated automatically on the back end by your service provider.*

  * At this stage, we can view the location of the attackers based on the IPAddress
    ```kql
    let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
    let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent;
    WindowsEvents | where EventID == 4625
    | order by TimeGenerated desc
    | evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)
    | summarize FailureCount = count() by IpAddress, latitude, longitude, cityname, countryname
    | project FailureCount, AttackerIp = IpAddress, latitude, longitude, city = cityname, country = countryname,
    friendly_location = strcat(cityname, " (", countryname, ")");
    ```

    ![LE](images/19.png)

### **6. Attack Map Visualization**

* In **Microsoft Sentinel**, open **Workbooks ‚Üí Add Workbook ‚Üí Windows VM Attack Map**.

  ![MV](images/20.png)
  
* Modify or create your own workbook using **Kusto Query Language (KQL)**:
  ```kql
  let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
  let WindowsEvents = SecurityEvent;
  WindowsEvents | where EventID == 4625
  | order by TimeGenerated desc
  | evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)
  | summarize FailureCount = count() by IpAddress, latitude, longitude, cityname, countryname
  | project FailureCount, AttackerIp = IpAddress, latitude, longitude, city = cityname, country = countryname,
  friendly_location = strcat(cityname, " (", countryname, ")");
  ```

* Visualize the results on a **World Map** to see attack origins.
